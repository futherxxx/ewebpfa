            <p><u><strong>Fund Manager's Report on NLPC PFA Global (RSA) Fund and NLPC PFA Retiree Fund as at 31st December, 2014</strong></u></p>
            <p style="margin-top:15px"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">The investment environment was a bit hostile in the last quarter of 2014 as the equities market witnessed a lot of volatility compared to Q3, 14. The equities market had a free fall only to rally towards the end of the year but this could not sustain the market to close in the positive region as it succumb to macro economic factors.</p>

            <p style="margin-top:20px"><strong>Economics and Market Review</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">The economy measured by the Real GDP grew by 6.23% in Q3,14 higher than Q3,13 by 1.06% but lower than Q2,14 by 0.31%. Relative to Q2,14, the economy grew by 8.67% in Q3,14. The oil sector experienced production challenges as the average daily production of crude oil in Q3,14 was 2.15mbpd a decrease from 2.26 mbpd recorded in Q3,13 and 2.21mbpd recorded in Q2,14. The non-oil sector growth was driven by growth in activities recorded in crop production, Textile, Apparel and Footwear; Telecommunications and Real Estate sectors. In Q3, 14, the non-oil sector recorded 7.51% growth in real terms, lower compared to 8.46% at the corresponding period in 2013, yet higher than 6.71% in Q2, 14.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:10px;text-align:justify">The coupon rates on Federal Government Bonds closed higher at the December, 2014 Primary market auction with stop rates on 3-year FGN Bond, 10-year FGN Bond and 20-year FGN Bond closing at 15.4900%, 15.2000% and 15.2990% respectively.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:10px;text-align:justify">The Nigerian equities market measured by NSE- ASI ended the year 2014 as one of the worst performing indexes globally as the market lost 16.14% during the year to close at 34,657.15 points from 41,329.19 points at the beginning of the year. This performance was a far cry from the performance of the market in 2013 when the market returned over 40%. The major factors that affected the equities market in 2014 was the uncertainty surrounding the 2015 general elections as foreign and local investors exited the market in numbers making the bear to completely dominate the market. This problem was further compounded by the fall in crude oil price in the international market.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:10px;text-align:justify">At the official segment of the foreign exchange market, the Naira depreciated to close the month at N168.00/$1 as against N155.73/$1 in September, 2014. At the parallel market, the Naira also depreciated against the Dollar to close at N191.00/$1 in December, 2014 as against N167.70/$1 in September, 2014.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:10px;text-align:justify">The latest official inflation rate as released by the Bureau of Statistics shows a 12 months average of 8.00% while the year-on -year change was 7.90 % compared to a 12 month average of 8.01% and year- on -year change of 8.30% in September, 2014.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">
                We are optimistic that recovery of the equity market will begin after the uncertainties surrounding the February 2015 elections are over. We expect the market to still continue to go down in Q1,15 and this will create opportunities for discerning investors which will eventually lead to 5-10 percent market correction. In Q2, 15 we may witness sharp recovery which will make the market to be stable while in Q3 and Q4, 2015 we expect to see growth.
                Consequently, we shall continue to maintain our medium to long term view of the equity market. Whilst holding on to stocks with good fundamentals, we shall continue to increase our holdings as buy opportunities exist.
                We are optimistic that the current macro-economic factors will make fixed income investments more attractive in 2015. Therefore, we shall exploit the Bond Market, Treasury bills and Money Markets for safer investments with guaranteed returns to stabilize the performance of the portfolios.
                We will continue to focus on our goal of growing the Fund under management by optimizing returns on investment without compromising the security and liquidity of assets and also ensuring that every worker with retirement savings account with the company receives his/ her benefits as at when due.
